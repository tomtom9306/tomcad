# Design Philosophy

## Simplicity First
TomCAD is designed to be **so intuitive** that even **someone without previous experience in CAD systems** can operate it effectively. We aim for the simplicity of **Tinkercad** but with the power needed for professional structural steel design.

This approach enables easy engagement of personnel with **extensive steel industry experience** but limited CAD knowledge. Experienced welders, installers, and fabricators who can no longer perform physical work due to health constraints can seamlessly transition into design and detailing roles, bringing their valuable practical knowledge to the digital workspace.

## Best-in-Class Features
We borrow the most successful concepts from leading CAD applications:

- **SolidWorks**: Parametric modeling and feature-based design
- **Inventor**: Assembly constraints and intelligent relationships  
- **IronCAD**: Intuitive drag-and-drop workflow
- **Tekla**: Automatic connections, drawings, and reports generation
