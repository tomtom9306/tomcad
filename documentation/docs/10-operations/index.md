# Operations

This section covers all fabrication operations that can be applied to structural elements in TomCAD.

## Cutting Operations
- [Holes](holes.md) - Creating holes in structural elements
- [Slots](slots.md) - Slot and elongated hole operations
- [Cuts](cuts.md) - Rectangular and custom cuts

## Fastening Operations
- [Bolts](bolts.md) - Bolt groups and fastener systems
- [Welds](welds.md) - Weld symbols and connection details

## Operation Workflow

Operations in TomCAD are parametric and maintain their relationships with the parent elements, updating automatically when geometry changes.
