# Goalpost Structures

Goalpost structures are rigid frame systems consisting of two columns connected by a horizontal beam. TomCAD provides specialized tools for creating, analyzing, and detailing goalpost frames with advanced parametric capabilities.

## Goalpost Types

### Standard Goalpost Frames

| Frame Type | Description | Typical Use |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Portal Frame** | Single-span rigid frame | Industrial buildings |
| **Multi-Bay Frame** | Multiple connected frames | Large span structures |
| **Pitched Frame** | Inclined roof beam | Sloped roof buildings |
| **Mansard Frame** | Multi-slope roof | Architectural applications |
| **Tied Frame** | Frame with tie rod | Reduced foundation loads |

### Specialized Applications

| Application | Description | Key Features |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Crane Gantry** | Overhead crane support | High load capacity |
| **Bridge Bent** | Bridge support structure | Seismic resistance |
| **Transmission Tower** | Electrical transmission | Wind resistance |
| **Sports Facility** | Athletic field structures | Clear span requirements |

!!! tip "Goalpost Design"
    
    Consider the construction sequence when designing goalpost frames. Temporary bracing may be required during erection.

!!! warning "Lateral Stability"
    
    Goalpost frames are susceptible to lateral-torsional buckling. Ensure adequate lateral support and bracing systems.
