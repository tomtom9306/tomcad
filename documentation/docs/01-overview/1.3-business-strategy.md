# Business Strategy

## Business Goals & Market Strategy

### Affordable Professional Software
- **Pricing**: £30-50 per month subscription model
- **Target**: Achieve larger user base than Tekla Structures through accessibility
- **Philosophy**: Lower price barrier enables broader adoption across steel industry

### Mass Market Approach
Unlike expensive competitors (Tekla ~£600/month), TomCAD's affordable pricing makes it viable for:
- **Small fabrication workshops** that cannot justify expensive CAD licenses
- **Multiple license purchases** - easy to buy 5-10 licenses for team workflows
- **Occasional users** who don't do extensive detailing but need professional tools
- **Mixed discipline teams** working on steel projects

### Target Markets

**Current Users**: Steel detailers and fabrication teams

**Future Users** (as platform expands):
- **Structural Engineers**: Analysis and preliminary design
- **Architects**: Architectural steelwork integration  
- **Estimators**: Quantity takeoffs and cost analysis
- **Installation Teams**: Field reference and assembly guidance
- **Machine Operators**: CNC programming and workshop documentation
