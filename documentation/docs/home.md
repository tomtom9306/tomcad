# TomCAD Overview

## What is TomCAD?

TomCAD is a modern **client-side web application** for designing steel structures and architectural steelwork. It runs entirely in web browsers without requiring any server-side installation or cloud dependencies.

## Mission & Vision

TomCAD aims to **compete directly** with industry-leading structural steel design software including:

- **Tekla Structures**
- **Advance Steel** 
- **SDS/2**
- **StruCad**
- **Bocad**

Our goal is to create software that combines the **best features** from multiple CAD systems while maintaining **exceptional ease of use**.

### Business Goals & Market Strategy

**Affordable Professional Software**
- **Pricing**: £30-50 per month subscription model
- **Target**: Achieve larger user base than Tekla Structures through accessibility
- **Philosophy**: Lower price barrier enables broader adoption across steel industry

**Mass Market Approach**
Unlike expensive competitors (Tekla ~£600/month), TomCAD's affordable pricing makes it viable for:
- **Small fabrication workshops** that cannot justify expensive CAD licenses
- **Multiple license purchases** - easy to buy 5-10 licenses for team workflows
- **Occasional users** who don't do extensive detailing but need professional tools
- **Mixed discipline teams** working on steel projects

**Current Users**: Steel detailers and fabrication teams

**Future Users** (as platform expands):
- **Structural Engineers**: Analysis and preliminary design
- **Architects**: Architectural steelwork integration  
- **Estimators**: Quantity takeoffs and cost analysis
- **Installation Teams**: Field reference and assembly guidance
- **Machine Operators**: CNC programming and workshop documentation

**Long-term Vision**: Complete steel construction business management platform - from initial design through fabrication to installation, all in one subscription. Replace multiple expensive software solutions: CAD programs, estimating software, nesting applications, project management tools, and workshop systems - all at a fraction of traditional CAD costs.

## Design Philosophy

### Simplicity First
TomCAD is designed to be **so intuitive** that even **someone without previous experience in CAD systems** can operate it effectively. We aim for the simplicity of **Tinkercad** but with the power needed for professional structural steel design.

This approach enables easy engagement of personnel with **extensive steel industry experience** but limited CAD knowledge. Experienced welders, installers, and fabricators who can no longer perform physical work due to health constraints can seamlessly transition into design and detailing roles, bringing their valuable practical knowledge to the digital workspace.

### Best-in-Class Features
We borrow the most successful concepts from leading CAD applications:

- **SolidWorks**: Parametric modeling and feature-based design
- **Inventor**: Assembly constraints and intelligent relationships  
- **IronCAD**: Intuitive drag-and-drop workflow
- **Tekla**: Automatic connections, drawings, and reports generation

### Target Users

**Primary Users: Steel Detailers**
- Create detailed structural steel drawings
- Generate fabrication drawings automatically
- Produce material lists and reports
- Design connections and details

**Secondary Users: Fabrication Teams**
- Workshop personnel who need simple design modifications
- Quality control teams reviewing designs
- Project managers tracking progress
