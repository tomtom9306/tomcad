# Modelling

This section covers all aspects of 3D structural modelling in TomCAD, from basic elements to complex assemblies.

## Primary Elements
- [Beams](beams.md) - Creating and configuring beam elements
- [Columns](columns.md) - Column design and placement
- [Plates](plates.md) - Plate and panel elements

## Advanced Elements  
- [Connections](connections.md) - Joint and connection design
- [Stairs](stairs.md) - Stair and ladder structures
- [Goalpost Structures](goalpost.md) - Portal frame and goalpost systems

## Modelling Workflow

TomCAD's parametric modelling system ensures that all elements maintain their relationships and update automatically when changes are made.
