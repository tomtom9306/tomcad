## View Management

### Standard Views

Quick access to common architectural views:

```yaml
standard_views:

  back: [0, 1, 0]      # Back elevation
  left: [-1, 0, 0]     # Left elevation
  right: [1, 0, 0]     # Right elevation
  top: [0, 0, 1]       # Plan view
  bottom: [0, 0, -1]   # Bottom view
```

### Custom Views

Save and restore custom viewpoints:

1. **Position Camera**: Navigate to desired view
2. **Save View**: Right-click → "Save View"
3. **Name View**: Enter descriptive name
4. **Access**: Use View menu or shortcut

### View Transitions

Smooth animated transitions between views:

- **Duration**: Configurable transition time
- **Easing**: Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- **Path**: Optimal camera path calculation
- **Interruption**: Can be stopped mid-transition

## View Cube Navigation

### Interactive View Cube

The view cube provides visual camera control:

- **Face Clicking**: Jump to standard views
- **Edge Clicking**: Rotate to edge views
- **Corner Clicking**: Rotate to corner views
- **Cube Dragging**: Free rotation control
- **Home Button**: Return to default view

### View Cube Configuration

```yaml
view_cube:
  position: top-right
  size: 80px
  opacity: 0.8
  auto_hide: false
  show_labels: true
  animation_speed: 0.5s
```

## Projection Modes

### Perspective Projection

Realistic 3D viewing with depth perception:

- **Field of View**: 45° default (adjustable 10°-120°)
- **Depth Cues**: Natural perspective distortion
- **Focal Length**: Camera lens simulation
- **Depth of Field**: Optional focus blur effects

### Orthographic Projection

Technical drawing view without perspective:

- **Parallel Lines**: Lines remain parallel
- **No Distortion**: True measurements preserved
- **Technical Drawings**: Ideal for documentation
- **Zoom Factor**: Scale-based zoom control

### Switching Projections

- **Keyboard**: Press `P` key to toggle
- **Menu**: View → Projection → Perspective/Orthographic
- **Auto-Switch**: Automatically use orthographic for technical views

## Camera Settings

### Movement Settings

```yaml
movement:
  orbit_speed: 1.0
  pan_speed: 1.0
  zoom_speed: 1.0
  rotation_damping: 0.1
  pan_damping: 0.1
  zoom_damping: 0.1
  min_distance: 0.1
  max_distance: 1000.0
```

### Behavior Settings

4. **Organize**: Group bookmarks by project phase

## Navigation Aids

### Grid Reference

Construction grid provides navigation reference:

- **Grid Lines**: Visual reference for movement
- **Snap Points**: Camera snaps to grid intersections
- **Grid Labels**: Coordinate system reference

- **Viewing Direction**: Shows camera orientation
- **Model Outline**: Simplified model representation
- **Click Navigation**: Click to move camera

## Performance Optimization

### Level of Detail (LOD)

Automatic model simplification based on view distance:

- **High Detail**: Close-up views show full geometry
- **Medium Detail**: Mid-range views use simplified geometry
- **Low Detail**: Distant views use bounding boxes
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gradual detail changes

### Frustum Culling

Hide geometry outside camera view:

- **View Frustum**: Only render visible geometry
- **Occlusion Culling**: Hide geometry behind other objects
- **Performance**: Significant performance improvement
- **Accuracy**: Maintains visual accuracy

### Adaptive Quality

Adjust rendering quality based on movement:

- **Static Quality**: High quality when camera is still
- **Motion Quality**: Reduced quality during movement
- **Threshold**: Configurable quality thresholds
- **Recovery**: Quick return to high quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Stuck or Jumpy

**Symptoms**: Camera doesn't move smoothly or gets stuck

**Solutions**:
- Reset camera: Press `Home` key
- Check mouse sensitivity settings
- Clear browser cache
- Restart TomCAD

#### Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: Slow camera movement or lag

**Solutions**:
- Reduce model complexity
- Enable LOD (Level of Detail)
- Close other browser tabs
- Update graphics drivers

#### View Cube Issues

**Symptoms**: View cube not responding

**Solutions**:
- Enable view cube in settings
- Check WebGL support
- Refresh browser
- Try different browser

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Standard Views**: Use predefined views for common tasks
2. **Use View Cube**: Quick access to standard orientations
3. **Save Important Views**: Bookmark frequently used viewpoints
4. **Smooth Movements**: Avoid rapid camera movements
5. **Regular Resets**: Use fit view to reset when lost

!!! tip "Navigation Tip"
    
    Use the middle mouse button for panning - it's the most natural way to move around your model without changing the viewing angle.

!!! warning "Performance Warning"
    
    Very large models may experience slower camera movement. Use the Level of Detail settings to improve performance during navigation.
